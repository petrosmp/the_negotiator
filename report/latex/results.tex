\paragraph{}
 The Negotiator agent was able to participate in the Technical University Of Crete competition and win the 2nd place. This proves that the meta agent strategy is effective in negotiations with diverse agents.
The UCB algorithm is effective in making the Negotiator adaptive, but also the prior knowledge from the Neural Network gives it a substancial headstart. As the research paper 
\cite{meta_agent_paper} stated, a little learning does indeed go a long way.
\paragraph{}
The results that the Neural Network produced seem logical and it manages to capture the corellation between the characteristics of a domain and the optimal agent, with our preliminary testing. As seen in the log files
of the competition and as tested the UCB algorithm works correctly, adjusting as expected after each round.
